/**
 * Property CorrectElevator:
 * 1. An elevator has to have been requested to go to a floor before it can
 *    go to that floor and reach that floor.
 * 2. Once requested to go to a floor, the elevator can be repeatedly requested to
 *    go to that floor, go to that floor, and reach that floor, but not other floors.
 * 3. A RESET resets the system to its initial state for all elevators.
 *
 * Property 1 is essentially a past time temporal property that without indexing would
 * have to be expressed using facts (as in rule-based programming). With indexing we
 * can utilize the same technique as done in slicing based systems such as MOP.
